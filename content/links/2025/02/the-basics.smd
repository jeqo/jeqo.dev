This is a great reminder of behaviors that need to keep practicing and improving.
As the author well put it: they are the basics not because they are easy, but because they are fundamental.

Here are a few of the basics mentioned that I found particularly personal as I've been guilty of not following them more often than I'd like to admit:

> Keep your change free of unrelated changes.

> Before you comment on something, read the whole thing.

> Read the manual, the docs, the instructions, the ticket.

> Know why your fix is a fix.

Thanks for putting this together, Thorsten!
