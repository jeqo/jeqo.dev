## GitHub markdown quote syntax for "Note" and "Warning"

URL: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts

Something I tend to forget when documenting on GitHub markdown is how to highlight notes and warnings.

The GitHub discussion that I usually found is here: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925

Where the syntax is as follows:

```markdown
> [!NOTE]  
> You can use **bold**, *italic*, `code`, and even [links](https://example.com) inside alerts.

> [!TIP]
> Optional information to help a user be more successful.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]  
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

> [!CAUTION]
> Negative potential consequences of an action.
```

This will render as:

[]($image.asset('preview.png'))

As far as I know this only works on GitHub, so you can use it in your READMEs, issues, and pull requests.
