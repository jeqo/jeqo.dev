### Quotes

> **The single most important fact about tourism is this: we already know what we will be like when we return.**
> A vacation is not like immigrating to a foreign country, or matriculating at a university, or starting a new job, or falling in love.
> We embark on those pursuits with the trepidation of one who enters a tunnel not knowing who she will be when she walks out.
> The traveller departs confident that she will come back with the same basic interests, political beliefs, and living arrangements.
> **Travel is a boomerang. It drops you right where you started.**

> If you think that this doesn’t apply to you—that your own travels are magical and profound, with effects that deepen your values, expand your horizons, render you a true citizen of the globe, and so on—note that this phenomenon can’t be assessed first-personally.
> Pessoa, Chesterton, Percy, and Emerson were all aware that travellers tell themselves they’ve changed, but you can’t rely on introspection to detect a delusion.
> **So cast your mind, instead, to any friends who are soon to set off on summer adventures.
> In what condition do you expect to find them when they return? They may speak of their travel as though it were transformative, a “once in a lifetime” experience, but will you be able to notice a difference in their behavior, their beliefs, their moral compass? Will there be any difference at all?**
