[]($image.asset('profile.jpg').id('profile').attrs('profile'))

I'm a peruvian open-source software developer focusing on data systems; currently Senior Software Engineer at [Aiven](https://aiven.io) based in Helsinki, Finland.
My main area of work is data streaming, with [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) at its core.

My professional journey began as a software consultant specializing in data integration with years of experience in Latin America, Norway, and the UK; 
culminating with three years as a Solution Architect at [Confluent](https://confluent.io) before transitioning to my current software engineering role.

While passionate about my work, life is much more than that---I'm a lucky father, husband, son, brother, and friend. 

I've come to realize that most things I love are difficult---even _painful_ at times. 
They take time and focus to learn, much more to master---if ever---, and may never reach a point of _completion_.
Took me a while to understand that that's OK---the gratitude of **being able to try** and pursue these passions overcomes everything else.

Playing Football (_FÃºtbol_) has been a constant in my life. 
I started very early and built my youth around it---even entertained the idea of being a professional, though it wasn't for me.

From the many things it taught me, Running became a lasting passion. 
I'd been running since then, usually helped by the [Nike Run Club App](https://www.nike.com/nrc-app) and [Coach Bennett](https://www.instagram.com/coachbennett/), recently achieving my first marathon(!).

Playing the Piano is my newest pursuit. 
Just being able to resemble anything close to beautiful pieces of music---like [Porz Goret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwwwWz6Ef3I)---makes me happy.

I have a growing collection of clouds, sky, and tree photographs (poorly) taken with my phone that I'll use as post headers.

I started this site as a new version of my (now) old blog site: [jeqo.github.io](https://jeqo.github.io) as an opportunity to start fresh, and---hopefully---add writing to the practices I was describing before.

It's built using [Zine](https://zine-ssg.io)---even though on early versions, I like its principles, and it's a great excuse to learn [Zig](https://ziglang.org).
