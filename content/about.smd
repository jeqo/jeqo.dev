# Jorge Esteban Quilcate Otoya

I'm an open-source software developer with a focus on data systems, currently Senior Software Engineer at [Aiven](https://aiven.io).
Data streaming has been my main area of work with [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) at its core.

My journey began as a consultant specializing in data integration across Latin America, Norway, and the UK, culminating in three years as a Solution Architect at [Confluent](https://confluent.io) before transitioning to my current software engineering role.

While I'm passionate about my work, life is much more than that---I'm a blessed father, husband, son, brother, and friend. 

I've come to realize that most things I love are _painful_. 
They take time to learn and master, if ever, and I may never reach a point where I would feel like _I've done it_.
That's ok---The gratitude on **being able to try** and pursue these passions overcomes everything else.

Playing _f√∫tbol_ has been constant in my life. 
I started very early, built my youth around it, and even entertained the idea of being a professional, though it wasn't for me.

From the many things it taught me, Running became a lasting passion. 
I'm been running since then, usually helped by the [Nike Run Club](https://www.nike.com/nrc-app) app and [Coach Bennett](https://www.instagram.com/coachbennett/), and (I"m proud to report) recently achieved my first Marathon.

Piano is my newest pursuit. Just being able to reproduce anything that resembles beautiful pieces of music, like [Porz Goret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwwwWz6Ef3I), makes me happy.

I have an unusual (I guess) number of pictures about clouds, the sky, and trees, (poorly) taken with my cellphone.
Haven't found a great way of sharing them, but post headers seem like a start.

I started this site as a new version of my (now) old blog: [jeqo.github.io](https://jeqo.github.io).

It's an opportunity to start fresh, and---hopefully---add writing to the practices I was describing before.

It's built using [Zine](https://zine-ssg.io)---Even though on early versions, I like its principles, and it's a great escuse to learn [Zig](https://ziglang.org).
